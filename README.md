# MovieFlix Database Exploration with SQL  
### A Structured Analysis of Customer Behavior, Revenue, and Inventory Using SQL

---

## Business Background

**MovieFlix Rentals** is a leading DVD rental service offering a wide collectionâ€”from Hollywood hits to indie favourites. With a focus on **customer convenience**, MovieFlix provides flexible rental plans and a hybrid delivery model (online reservations + local pickup). To support smooth operations and data-driven decision-making, the business uses a relational database to track:

- Customers
- Movie inventory
- Rentals
- Payments
- Staff and store operations

---

## Problem Statement

MovieFlix's SQL database captures rich operational data across its rentals, payments, and customer behaviors. However, **insights need to be surfaced** through structured queries to guide key decisions.

This project aims to:
- **Understand** the schema and relationships within the database
- **Extract insights** on customer behavior, store performance, and rental trends
- **Answer business-critical questions** using optimized SQL queries

---

## Project Goals

- Showcase practical **SQL querying skills** across multiple table joins
- Demonstrate an ability to explore and analyze structured business data
- Provide value by answering real-world operational and strategic questions
- Translate raw data into **clear, actionable insights**

---

## Database Schema

The dataset consists of **16 interrelated tables**, forming a full transactional database:

actor, address, category, city, country, customer, film, film_actor, film_category, inventory, language, payment, rental, staff, store


Key Relationships:
- **Customers** rent **films** from a **store**
- Each **rental** has a corresponding **payment**
- Films are categorized and have **inventory** in stores
- **Staff** process rentals and payments
- **Geographic data** is available via city, address, country

---

## Tech Stack & SQL Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`
- Conditional logic: `CASE`, `WHERE`
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Data exploration with `DISTINCT`, `IS NULL`, `IN`

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Database Restoration**  
   Setup the MovieFlix SQL schema and populate it with sample data.

2. **Data Familiarization**  
   Review schema relationships and column meanings.

3. **Query Development**  
   Write queries to answer layered business questions.

4. **Insight Generation**  
   Translate query results into insights about inventory, revenue, and customer behavior.

## Business Questions Answered

### Movie Inventory Exploration

- Retrieve all movies in the database.
- List titles of movies with rental durations > 5 days.
- Find total number of movies.
- Count movies by rating (e.g., PG, R).

### Customer Rental Behavior

- Classify customers into **spending tiers** based on total payments.
- Identify the **top 10 most rented movies** and how often they were rented.
- Detect customers with **payments but no rentals** (data anomalies).

### Revenue and Payment Analysis

- Determine which **staff handled the most rentals** and how much revenue they generated.
- Calculate **average rental durations** by store.
- Analyze **store-level revenue**, and determine what percentage comes from **late fees**.

## Key Learnings

- Strong familiarity with normalized relational data and schema relationships
- Ability to use SQL for **analytical storytelling**
- Understanding of operational KPIs in a **retail entertainment business**
- Experience working with multi-table queries and joins for **real-world questions**
